## Read the Instructions for the SchemaCrawler Diagram Example

Click on the "Examples Browser" tab. You will see `diagram` in the list of examples. Click on the `diagram` folder. Open the diagram read-me file.


## Run the SchemaCrawler Diagram Example

Switch back to the terminal, but clicking on the "Terminal" tab. Change to the `diagram` folder, run:

`cd ~/schemacrawler-16.12.1-distribution/examples/diagram`{{execute}}

Try SchemaCrawler diagram, run:

`./diagram.sh`{{execute}}

(You can see the script for generating the diagram by running `cat diagram.sh`{{copy}}.)

This will produce a PDF file called `database-diagram.pdf`. To view this file, click on refresh button on the "Examples Browser" tab. Navigate back to the the `diagram` folder, and you will see the new file. Click on the `database-diagram.pdf` file to view it.
